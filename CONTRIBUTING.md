* List items should be sorted _alphabetically_.
* Each item should be limited to one link.
* The link should be the name of the project or article title.
* Descriptions should be clear, concise and non-promotional.
* Descriptions should follow the link, on the same line.
* Needs bibliotica 3 (minimum) to create a new category.

Please contribute links to packages/projects you have used or are familiar with. This 
will help ensure high-quality entries.

## Reporting Issues

Please open an issue if you would like to discuss anything that could be improved or 
have suggestions for making the list a more valuable resource. We realize sometimes
projects fall into abandonment or have breaking builds for extended periods of time,
so if you see that, feel free to change its listing or let us know. We also realize
that sometimes projects are just going through transitions or are more experimental
in nature. These can still be cool, but we can indicate them as transitory or
experimental.

Removal changes will not be applied until they have been pending for a mimimum of 1
week (7 days). This grace window benefits projects that may be going through a 
temporary transition but are otherwise worthy of being on the list.
